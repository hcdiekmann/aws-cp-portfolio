# aws-cp-portfolio
Final portfolio for AWS Cloud Practitioner course

### Objective
Provide a cheap cloud-based web server, with a decoupled data tier using a managed database service. Because of the tight budget, the client only need one compute instance, and one decoupled database.  Resilience of compute is not expected , therefore there is no need for scaling, load balancing or multiple EC2s across AZs.
